  1 |              3 |          2 | what is in your bag?     | Hi there. Thank you so much for the great review. We are glad you had an incredible time, and we hope to see you again soon! Thanks for choosing Los Lagos at Costa Mesa Golf & Country Club.                                                         | 2022-09-12
  3 |              3 |          2 | never too late or is it? | rancho_park is in great shape overall but the fairways in many areas are getting divot laced. 3 very good tee shots and my ball finished in a fairway divot....two of those times in areas that it was almost impossible to avoid them unfortunately. | 2022-01-11
